## UIHostingController Containment Bug — .searchable Keyboard Disappears (February 2026)

### Problem
After interacting with any TextInput on the Settings tab (which opens a tvOS keyboard dialog/UIAlertController), navigating to the Search tab caused the native `.searchable` SwiftUI keyboard to stop appearing entirely. Fresh app launches worked fine.

### Root Cause
In `expo-tvos-search`, the `UIHostingController` hosting the SwiftUI `NavigationView` with `.searchable` was created and its **view** was added as a subview, but the controller itself was never added as a child view controller via `addChild`/`didMove(toParent:)`. This meant:
- The hosting controller never received `viewWillAppear`/`viewDidAppear` lifecycle events
- SwiftUI's `.searchable` modifier relies on UIKit's focus system integration, which requires proper VC containment
- It worked "by accident" on fresh launch (no prior focus state to conflict with)
- After a Settings TextInput opened a UIAlertController (keyboard dialog), UIKit's focus engine state changed, and returning to Search, the focus engine couldn't route focus back to `.searchable` because the hosting controller wasn't in the VC hierarchy

### Solution
Added proper UIKit view controller containment in `ExpoTvosSearchView.swift`:
1. `didMoveToWindow()` override — when view enters a window, find nearest parent VC via responder chain and call `addChild`/`didMove(toParent:)`. When removed, call `willMove(toParent: nil)`/`removeFromParent()`
2. Early containment in `setupView()` for cases where the view already has a window at setup time
3. Cleanup in `deinit` to remove VC relationship

### What Went Wrong
- First attempt tried `Keyboard.dismiss()` + `.blur()` cleanup in settings.tsx `useFocusEffect` — this was a red herring because the issue wasn't a lingering first responder on the JS side
- The real issue was a missing Apple-documented UIKit pattern in the native Swift library

### What Worked
- Reading Apple's documentation on UIHostingController containment requirements
- Tracing the lifecycle: Settings TextInput -> UIAlertController -> focus engine state change -> missing VC hierarchy -> .searchable can't reclaim focus

### Key Takeaways
1. **UIHostingController requires proper child VC containment** — adding just the `.view` as a subview is not sufficient. Without `addChild`/`didMove(toParent:)`, SwiftUI never receives lifecycle events
2. **"Works on first launch but breaks after X" is a containment/lifecycle smell** — if something works initially but breaks after unrelated UIKit interactions, suspect missing lifecycle integration
3. **Focus engine bugs on tvOS are often VC hierarchy bugs** — the tvOS focus engine relies on the view controller hierarchy to route focus. If a VC isn't in the hierarchy, its views can't participate in focus updates

### Files Affected
- `expo-tvos-search/ios/ExpoTvosSearchView.swift` (library fix)
- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (defensive cleanup, kept but not the fix)

## Audio Track Label Bug (January 2026)

### Problem
tvOS showed "Unknown language" instead of track name for undefined language tracks in the native audio picker.

### Root Cause
iOS/tvOS **ALWAYS prioritizes LANGUAGE attribute** over NAME for display in native picker. When LANGUAGE="und" (undefined), iOS displays its own localized string "Unknown language" regardless of what NAME says.

### Solution
Omit LANGUAGE attribute entirely for "und" tracks. Per RFC 8216, LANGUAGE is OPTIONAL. When LANGUAGE is omitted, iOS falls back to displaying the NAME attribute.

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Proposed solutions without reading Apple HLS spec
- ❌ Assumed LANGUAGE was required (it's optional per RFC 8216)
- ❌ Went in circles trying NAME variations without understanding root cause
- ❌ Forgot platform context (iOS HLS ≠ generic HLS)
- ❌ Didn't read the actual Swift implementation before suggesting changes

### What Worked
- ✅ Read RFC 8216 to confirm LANGUAGE is optional
- ✅ Read Apple HLS Authoring Specification
- ✅ Inspected actual Swift code in `native/ios/MultiAudioResourceLoader/`
- ✅ Tested one solution at a time with clear hypothesis
- ✅ Asked user for confirmation before implementing

### Key Takeaways
1. **Display and auto-selection are separate concerns:**
   - LANGUAGE/NAME control what's displayed in picker
   - DEFAULT/AUTOSELECT control which track plays automatically
2. **Platform-specific behavior requires platform-specific documentation:**
   - Generic HLS specs (RFC 8216) define what's allowed
   - Apple HLS implementation defines actual behavior on iOS/tvOS
3. **Read implementation code BEFORE proposing solutions:**
   - Assumptions about how code works are often wrong
   - 5 minutes reading Swift code saves hours of iteration

### Files Affected
- `native/ios/MultiAudioResourceLoader/HLSManifestGenerator.swift:156-180`

### Commit
- Hash: 703c7a2
- Message: "fix: audio tracks show correct name, no default selected mark in list tradeoff"

## Compliance Test Anti-Pattern (January 2026)

### Problem
AI-generated tests sometimes use `fs.readFileSync` to scan source code files and assert on string presence/absence, rather than testing actual runtime behavior. These "compliance tests" provide false confidence and test nothing meaningful.

### Root Cause
When asked to verify a code property (e.g., "ensure no console.log statements"), the path of least resistance is to read the source file and check for string patterns. This satisfies the request superficially but doesn't exercise any code paths.

### Solution
Established a rule: **all tests must exercise actual code paths.** If the only way to verify something is scanning source text, use a linter rule instead or skip the test entirely. No test is better than a fake test.

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Used `fs.readFileSync` in test files to scan source code
- ❌ Asserted on code text patterns instead of runtime behavior
- ❌ Created tests that pass/fail based on string matching, not functionality
- ❌ Provided false confidence that "everything is tested"

### What Worked
- ✅ Identified the anti-pattern and documented it
- ✅ Added explicit rule to testing best practices
- ✅ Audited all existing test files for violations (none found)
- ✅ Clear guidance: use ESLint for code style, Jest for behavior

### Key Takeaways
1. **Tests must exercise code paths:** A test that reads source files is not a test — it's a linter with extra steps
2. **No test > fake test:** If you can't write a meaningful behavioral test, skip it
3. **Right tool for the job:** Use ESLint for code style enforcement, Jest for behavior verification
4. **Question AI-generated tests:** Compliance tests are a common AI failure mode — always review test quality, not just quantity

### Files Affected
- `memories/CLAUDE-testing.md` (added No Compliance Tests rule)
- No existing test files were in violation

## False Apple Docs Claim in tvOS Focus Fix (January 2026)

### Problem
Implemented a tvOS focus restoration function based on an unverified claim about Apple's documentation. The code comment stated "Per Apple docs, UIKit rebuilds the focus spatial map when a focusable view is removed from the hierarchy." This claim was false.

### Root Cause
The plan stated an Apple docs fact that was never verified. The implementation was coded, commented, and JSDoc'd with "Per Apple docs" without anyone checking what Apple actually says. What Apple actually says: "UIKit automatically updates focus when a **focused** view is removed from the view hierarchy." The word "focused" is critical — it means the currently-focused view, not any arbitrary focusable view. Additionally, Apple doesn't use the term "spatial map" at all.

### Solution
Caught the error when the user asked for verification. Research confirmed the claim was false. The implementation (adding/removing a non-focused temporary focusable view) is almost certainly a no-op — UIKit has no reason to do anything when a view that never had focus is removed.

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Implemented a plan without verifying its core assumption
- ❌ Wrote "Per Apple docs" in code comments without reading Apple docs
- ❌ Treated the plan's assertion as fact and coded it without due diligence
- ❌ The plan itself had ~50% confidence but the code comments stated it as documented fact
- ❌ Violated the Research-First Protocol from CLAUDE.md

### What Worked
- ✅ User asked a direct yes/no verification question
- ✅ Fetched actual Apple documentation (App Programming Guide for tvOS, WWDC 2016/2017 transcripts)
- ✅ Found the exact discrepancy: "focused view" vs "any focusable view"
- ✅ Admitted the error immediately and transparently

### Key Takeaways
1. **Never write "Per docs" without reading the docs:** If a plan claims something is documented, verify it before implementing. "Per Apple docs" in a code comment is a factual assertion — treat it with the same rigor as a test assertion.
2. **Verify facts from plans the same way you'd verify facts from memory:** A plan written by an AI is not a primary source. It can be wrong. The plan said "Per Apple docs" but had never checked.
3. **Low-confidence plans need higher verification, not lower:** The plan stated ~50% confidence. That should have triggered MORE verification, not less.
4. **The Research-First Protocol exists for a reason:** CLAUDE.md says "NEVER propose solutions based on assumptions alone." This applies to implementing plans too — the plan was the assumption.

### Files Affected
- `@keiver/expo-tvos-search/ios/ExpoTvosSearchModule.swift` (incorrect implementation)
- `@keiver/expo-tvos-search/src/index.tsx` (incorrect JSDoc)

## tvOS FlatList Focus Escape Bug (January 2026)

### Problem
Focus cannot escape FlatList to reach tab bar when pressing UP. Within the grid, up/down/left/right navigation works. But vertical navigation to elements OUTSIDE the ScrollView (like tab bar) is blocked.

### Root Cause (CONFIRMED)
`RCTScrollViewComponentView.mm` lines 1177-1182 contains an overly restrictive containment check:

```objc
BOOL isMovingUp = (context.focusHeading == UIFocusHeadingUp && self.scrollView.contentOffset.y > 0);
BOOL isMovingDown = (context.focusHeading == UIFocusHeadingDown &&
    self.scrollView.contentOffset.y < self.scrollView.contentSize.height - MAX(self.scrollView.visibleSize.height, 1));

if (isMovingUp || isMovingDown) {
    return (context.nextFocusedItem && [UIFocusSystem environment:self containsEnvironment:context.nextFocusedItem]);
}
```

When scrolled (`contentOffset.y > 0`), pressing UP triggers the containment check. If `nextFocusedItem` (tab bar) is OUTSIDE the ScrollView, `containsEnvironment` returns NO, blocking the focus update entirely.

### What We Ruled Out
- ❌ **Video overlay / modal transitions** — Bug exists without playing video
- ❌ **expo-router / react-navigation** — Not involved
- ❌ **TVFocusGuideView** — Our addition made it worse, but bug exists without it
- ❌ **expo-tvos-search native module** — Not the cause
- ❌ **requestTVFocus() with staggered delays** — Controls position, not traversal
- ❌ **hasTVPreferredFocus** — Only affects initial mount
- ❌ **setNeedsFocusUpdate()** — Controls where focus goes, not if it CAN go

### Key Distinction
All attempted fixes work on **focus POSITION** (where focus is). The bug is in **focus TRAVERSAL** (where focus can go). These are separate systems in UIKit.

### What We Attempted (All Failed)
1. Multiple `requestTVFocus()` calls with staggered delays (150ms, 300ms, 500ms)
2. `TVFocusGuideView` wrapper with `autoFocus` and `destinations` props
3. `hasTVPreferredFocus={true}` on grid items
4. `focusRestoreKey` state to trigger re-evaluation
5. Passing refs via `forwardRef` to first grid item

### The Real Fix (Not Yet Implemented)
Patch `react-native-tvos` to change the containment check to defer to parent hierarchy when target exists outside:

```objc
if (isMovingUp || isMovingDown) {
    if (!context.nextFocusedItem) {
        return NO;  // No target, block (scroll instead)
    }
    if ([UIFocusSystem environment:self containsEnvironment:context.nextFocusedItem]) {
        return YES;  // Target inside scroll view, allow
    }
    // Target exists but OUTSIDE - defer to parent hierarchy
    return [super shouldUpdateFocusInContext:context];  // ← THE FIX
}
```

### Key Takeaways
1. **Focus position and focus traversal are different systems** — restoring position doesn't fix traversal
2. **Verify root cause before implementing fixes** — We wasted time on JS-level fixes when the bug is in native code
3. **Test without the suspected cause** — Testing grid navigation WITHOUT playing video proved overlay wasn't the issue
4. **Read the actual native code** — The answer was in `RCTScrollViewComponentView.mm` the whole time
5. **TVFocusGuideView can make things worse** — It interfered with normal focus behavior
6. **Core RN bugs require core RN patches** — JS-level workarounds cannot fix native containment checks

### Files Relevant
- `node_modules/react-native/React/Fabric/Mounting/ComponentViews/ScrollView/RCTScrollViewComponentView.mm:1177-1182` (the bug)
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (where we attempted JS fixes)

### Status
Codebase reset to clean state. Awaiting `patch-package` implementation to fix the native code.
