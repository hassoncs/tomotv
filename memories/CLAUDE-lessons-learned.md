## Audio Track Label Bug (January 2026)

### Problem
tvOS showed "Unknown language" instead of track name for undefined language tracks in the native audio picker.

### Root Cause
iOS/tvOS **ALWAYS prioritizes LANGUAGE attribute** over NAME for display in native picker. When LANGUAGE="und" (undefined), iOS displays its own localized string "Unknown language" regardless of what NAME says.

### Solution
Omit LANGUAGE attribute entirely for "und" tracks. Per RFC 8216, LANGUAGE is OPTIONAL. When LANGUAGE is omitted, iOS falls back to displaying the NAME attribute.

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Proposed solutions without reading Apple HLS spec
- ❌ Assumed LANGUAGE was required (it's optional per RFC 8216)
- ❌ Went in circles trying NAME variations without understanding root cause
- ❌ Forgot platform context (iOS HLS ≠ generic HLS)
- ❌ Didn't read the actual Swift implementation before suggesting changes

### What Worked
- ✅ Read RFC 8216 to confirm LANGUAGE is optional
- ✅ Read Apple HLS Authoring Specification
- ✅ Inspected actual Swift code in `native/ios/MultiAudioResourceLoader/`
- ✅ Tested one solution at a time with clear hypothesis
- ✅ Asked user for confirmation before implementing

### Key Takeaways
1. **Display and auto-selection are separate concerns:**
   - LANGUAGE/NAME control what's displayed in picker
   - DEFAULT/AUTOSELECT control which track plays automatically
2. **Platform-specific behavior requires platform-specific documentation:**
   - Generic HLS specs (RFC 8216) define what's allowed
   - Apple HLS implementation defines actual behavior on iOS/tvOS
3. **Read implementation code BEFORE proposing solutions:**
   - Assumptions about how code works are often wrong
   - 5 minutes reading Swift code saves hours of iteration

### Files Affected
- `native/ios/MultiAudioResourceLoader/HLSManifestGenerator.swift:156-180`

### Commit
- Hash: 703c7a2
- Message: "fix: audio tracks show correct name, no default selected mark in list tradeoff"

## Compliance Test Anti-Pattern (January 2026)

### Problem
AI-generated tests sometimes use `fs.readFileSync` to scan source code files and assert on string presence/absence, rather than testing actual runtime behavior. These "compliance tests" provide false confidence and test nothing meaningful.

### Root Cause
When asked to verify a code property (e.g., "ensure no console.log statements"), the path of least resistance is to read the source file and check for string patterns. This satisfies the request superficially but doesn't exercise any code paths.

### Solution
Established a rule: **all tests must exercise actual code paths.** If the only way to verify something is scanning source text, use a linter rule instead or skip the test entirely. No test is better than a fake test.

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Used `fs.readFileSync` in test files to scan source code
- ❌ Asserted on code text patterns instead of runtime behavior
- ❌ Created tests that pass/fail based on string matching, not functionality
- ❌ Provided false confidence that "everything is tested"

### What Worked
- ✅ Identified the anti-pattern and documented it
- ✅ Added explicit rule to testing best practices
- ✅ Audited all existing test files for violations (none found)
- ✅ Clear guidance: use ESLint for code style, Jest for behavior

### Key Takeaways
1. **Tests must exercise code paths:** A test that reads source files is not a test — it's a linter with extra steps
2. **No test > fake test:** If you can't write a meaningful behavioral test, skip it
3. **Right tool for the job:** Use ESLint for code style enforcement, Jest for behavior verification
4. **Question AI-generated tests:** Compliance tests are a common AI failure mode — always review test quality, not just quantity

### Files Affected
- `memories/CLAUDE-testing.md` (added No Compliance Tests rule)
- No existing test files were in violation
