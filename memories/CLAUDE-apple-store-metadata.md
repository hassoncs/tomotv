**Demo Account Information:**

```
For testing purposes, reviewers can use our demo Jellyfin server:

Server URL: [Provide a public demo server or local setup instructions]

Alternatively, set up a local Jellyfin server:

## App Store Optimization (ASO) Strategy

**Primary Goal:** Reach Jellyfin users searching for Apple TV clients

**Target Search Terms:**
1. "jellyfin apple tv" (exact match - high intent)
2. "jellyfin player" (broad - competitor to official app)
3. "media server apple tv" (adjacent - Plex users)
4. "video player apple tv" (broad - general market)
5. "transcode player" (specific - technical users)

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Primary competitor: Swiftfin (free, open source)
- Advantage: Smart transcoding UX, quality presets, simplified setup
- Disadvantage: Missing resume playback, metadata

**Conversion Strategy:**
- Lead with "automatic transcoding" (solves immediate pain)
- Emphasize Apple TV optimization (native feel)
- Show quality presets (control over experience)
- Include screenshot of help section (reduces support burden)
