## 🚀 Next Steps (Before Submission)

### 1. Deploy Website Pages ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
Before submitting to App Store, you MUST deploy your keiver.dev website so the URLs are live:

```bash
cd ~/keiver.dev
# Build the site (assuming Next.js)
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

**Verify these URLs work:**
- https://keiver.dev/lab/tomotv
- https://keiver.dev/lab/tomotv-privacy
- https://keiver.dev/lab/tomotv-support

### 2. Add Screenshots
**Action Required:** Add TomoTV screenshots to `~/keiver.dev/public/screenshots/tomotv/`

You mentioned you'll add screenshots—place them in the directory that was created:
- `~/keiver.dev/public/screenshots/tomotv/`

Recommended screenshots:
- `1.webp` - Library grid view
- `2.webp` - Video player with controls
- `3.webp` - Search screen with results
- `4.webp` - Settings screen
- `5.webp` - Help screen

Then update `tomotv.tsx` to use real screenshots instead of placeholders (lines 139-167).

### 3. Update Apple App ID
**Action Required:** Once you create the app in App Store Connect, update:

1. `~/keiver.dev/pages/lab/tomotv.tsx` line 106:
   ```tsx
   <meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=YOUR_APP_ID_HERE" />
   ```

2. Update App Store button URLs in `tomotv.tsx` line 128:
   ```tsx
   appStoreUrl="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tomotv/YOUR_APP_ID"
   ```

### 4. Take Apple TV Screenshots (1920x1080)
For App Store Connect, you need actual Apple TV screenshots:
- Size: 1920x1080 pixels
- Required: 3-5 screenshots
- Take screenshots showing:
  1. Library view (with poster art)
  2. Video player
  3. Settings screen
  4. Search with results
  5. Help screen

### 5. Optional: Create App Icon for Website
Consider creating a TomoTV icon for the website (currently using emoji 📺).

Upload to: `~/keiver.dev/public/screenshots/tomotv/icon.png`
